v3.1 / 2022-07-19 15:19:32 +0900:
- doc: Changelog #60
  Added txt changelog and script for generating it.

- bug: Binary 7 bit mode #59
  In binary 7-bit mode, ignore MSB. Look just at 7 LSBs - example 0x95 == 0x15.


v3.0 / 2022-07-13 16:31:09 +0900:
- bug: Issue with binary FIFO queue #57
  Few bugs were left after changing to FIFO queue.

- enh: Custom fmt chunk #49
  Improved parsing of WAVE file header. It should only get the information we need, regardless of number of chunks, and ignore other chunks.
Previously parsing was limited to fixed, 44 byte header. Improved parsing so it checks for the correct chunk and fetches only data that is needed.
No more fixed "fmt " chunk size.

- bug: Does not play with 3ch simultaneously #55
  Fixed Normal Play mode. It now supports all switches being pressed simultaneously.

- bug: Issue with binary FIFO queue #57
  Changed binary play mode to have FIFO queue. Previous specs were to have normal queue while playing.

- bug: Only 460ms of audio data of 500ms is played #56
  DMA was stopped before all the data could be output. Introduced wait loop to wait for DMA to finish everything.
Removed forgotten test code (LED_USBOff).
Disabled I2C polling after data is copied from USB.

- bug: Switch debounce - chattering #54
  If to consecutive scans (20 ms) show pressed button, we assume that a button is pressed.

- Gitgnore update.
  
- enh: Processing when an error occurs #52
  If any error is detected, MCU goes to infinite while loop. MCU can be reset (software reset) if STOP is pressed.

- bug: Pressing STB while STOP is pressed results in BUSY LED blink #58
  Inside binary play modes, when checking if stop is pressed, return from function if pressed. Previously it didn't return.

- bug: Audio file size #53
  NAND flash size was set to 2 Gbit, but actual flash size is 4 Gbit. Changed flash size.

- enh: Enabled DAC amplifier.
  
- bug: One count is missing when playing a WAVE file #50
  When fixing issue #40, round buffer check was shortened by 1 count.
To fix the current bug, round buffer check was restored and buffer size increased.
When 8-bit song is played, only half of the buffer is used.
When 16-bit song is played 1/4 of the buffer is used.


v2.0 / 2022-06-13 15:23:00 +0900:
- changelog: Included FW version in VoiceNaviMain.c
  
- bug: Ignore 8-bit data on 7-bit play mode
  Instead of ignoring just 7th bit, ignore all channels that are bigger than 127 (7-bit).

- bug: Input play mode doesn't cut the song #47
  Inserted detection if 2 signals are set at the same time. After double input, break the song playing and play the input that is still set.

- bug: Normal play mode channels should not alternate #46
  Reset previously pressed switch only if input is released. If input is pressed, remember previously pressed switch.

- bug: On interval delay watchdog timer triggers #45
  Because program was holding in while loop, watchdog timer reset the program. Added WDT reset into holding loop.

- bug:  Weird sound output on channels 9 to 12 #44
  Bug fixed. uint16_t value was going into uint8_t variable.

- enh: Watchdog implementation #43
  Implemented WDT. It starts automatically on power on. Period is about 522 ms.

- bug: Interrupt play was stuck in infinite loop.
  If forcefully stopped (interrupted), DMA buffer address wasn't reset. Added reset address.

- bug:  WPJ file corruption not detected #41
  Implemented full file corruption detection. If random file has extension wpj, error will be shown.

- bug: Non exclusive errors to exclusive errors
  Created exclusive errors. If one error happened before other, some weird blinking would occur. This is now fixed. First error has priority, further errors are not displayed.

- bug: Flash management for playlist table.
  Configured flash management for playlist table. If corrupted blocks are in beginning of flash, those blocks are skipped and data is written to next available block.

- bug: Output sound is cut at the beginning #40
  8-bit audio was stuck in first loop when filling play buffer. Fixed.

- bug: Output sound is cut at the beginning #40
  Fixed cut sound at start. Reduced delay from start signal to actual playback.

- bug: Popping sound #39
  Fixed bug introduced with commit: ac1170cda641362c732f92e4deb73e2e657df66c

- hw: New hardware revision.

- bug: Binary modes play range #34
  Extended number of playable channels.

- bug: 5F9 normal play mode not working #35
  Bug is now fixed, introduced in 45fcea581293f8e339a4f3677873bf2401642c7a.
