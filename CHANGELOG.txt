v3.9 / 2022-09-16 16:45:28 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.9
  
- bug: 5A2,5F1,5F2 inputPlay mode #83
  Reverted changes and implemented the correct stop condition.

- bug: 5F9 lastInputInterruptPlay_5F9IH mode #84
  Changed already_pressed_mask variable from uint8_t to uint16_t.


v3.8 / 2022-09-07 17:13:50 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.8
  
- bug: USB_LED #81
  After data copy from USB to flash is finished, goto while(1) loop regardless of NAND_WRITE status. If write was success, start led success pattern, otherwise error pattern.

- enh: faster polling time for 5F9 board.
  Forgot to remove LED_USBToggle().

- enh: faster polling time for 5F9 board.
  Polling time changed from 3,5 ms to 2,5 ms.

- bug: 5F9 normal play mode not working #35
  Do not interrupt the same channel. Interrupt only different channels.


v3.7 / 2022-08-31 09:26:14 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.7
  
- bug: double scan on all pins in binary mode
  Previously only GPIOB had debounce feature. Now both GPIOB and GPIOA have debounce feature.


v3.6 / 2022-08-30 12:30:20 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.6
  
- bug: No debounce in binary play mode #80
  Forgot to commit come files.

- test: updated 50ms pulse test case.
  
- bug: No debounce in binary play mode #80
  Different debounce time for 5F9 board. No more interrupt, just polling.

- bug: No debounce in binary play mode #80
  Implemented debounce on GPIOB (GPIO mux). In binary mode, only STOP and STB pins are effected by debounce. SW1 to SW8 are not.


v3.5 / 2022-08-24 12:40:30 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.5
  
- bug: Problems with debounce #79
  Reverted changes from commits: fb99b7e43ed17c6dd3ab5cf8e45db1de0d2adf7f and 75be721b1dd858583bdb0bc5dac36ead643cbca6. New mechanism for detecting 2 consecutive pulses on all channels.

- bug: Problems with debounce #79
  Changed polling frequency 60 -> 65 Hz. Changed TUP0 interrupt priority from 15 to 13. Minor bug fixes in lastInputInterruptPlay().


v3.4 / 2022-08-17 15:41:49 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.4
  
- bug: last input interrupt play multi input fix
  Multi input wasn't working. Only 1 or 2 switches were working. Now, you can press all the switches and only the last pressed channel will play.

- bug: Normal play mode - scanning next switch #75
  During level play, if switch(es) are pressed, and STOP in introduced, start playing last played channel after stop is released.

- bug: FIFO queue 5 slots #74
  FIFO queue status did not reset if STOP signal was pressed. Fixed.

- bug: Stereo file error - busy signal stays on #73
  PIN_ShutdownReset() wasn't called if stereo or wave file error occurred. Fixed.

- bug: Input play not working as expected #77
  Play mode adjusted according to specifications. Also found a bug when song play is interrupted - busy signal didn't go to off state.

- bug: Debounce on individual channel #76
  Always check switch status 3 times, when first input signal comes.

- bug: Debounce on individual channel #76
  Any switch must be pressed for 3 consecutive scans. If on first and last scan a the same switch is pressed, we assume that pulse is long enough (50 ms or more) and go into play mode.

- bug: Normal play mode - scanning next switch #75
  Example: if CH1 was played and stopped, next time SW1 and SW2 are pressed simultaneously, CH2 should start playing. Before the fix, CH1 started playing.

- bug: FIFO queue 5 slots #74
  When FIFO is full, it has to wait 5 slots until we can put data in again.

- bug: Stereo file error - busy signal stays on #73
  Only LED turned off when stereo file error was called. Forgot to also turn off busy pin. Fixed.

- bug: Short files - busy signal always on #71
  If file size is shorter than buffer size, read only file size.


v3.3 / 2022-07-28 15:16:06 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.3
  
- enh: better error detecting of faulty wave files.
  If "fmt " or "data" chunk sizes are zero, throw error.

- enh: Not FAT format error message #69
  Changed error status to wave file error.


v3.2 / 2022-07-26 16:37:32 +0900:
- log: Version update - v3.2
  
- bug: ERR check #63
  Improved checking if USB flash drive has correct file system or not. Also, some error messages were wrong.

- bug: Error status not showing on bad wave file #62
  When creating CMT timer, the same channel was auto chosen for I2C polling and for errors. Errors now have fixed CMT channel - 3.

- Revert "enh: Processing when an error occurs #52"
  This reverts commit e224e53f1f13ccd0e31e0ad02e26d572b203eecf.
Resetting error only resets LEDs. It happens after new input signal is detected (any channel or stop signal).

Implemented better wave file error detection. If file is partially corrupted, if by the time we reach end of file we don't get fmt and data chunk info, error flag is set.


v3.1 / 2022-07-19 15:31:39 +0900:
- Licence and version update.
  
- doc: Changelog #60
  Added txt changelog and script for generating it.

- bug: Binary 7 bit mode #59
  In binary 7-bit mode, ignore MSB. Look just at 7 LSBs - example 0x95 == 0x15.


v3.0 / 2022-07-13 16:31:09 +0900:
- bug: Issue with binary FIFO queue #57
  Few bugs were left after changing to FIFO queue.

- enh: Custom fmt chunk #49
  Improved parsing of WAVE file header. It should only get the information we need, regardless of number of chunks, and ignore other chunks.
Previously parsing was limited to fixed, 44 byte header. Improved parsing so it checks for the correct chunk and fetches only data that is needed.
No more fixed "fmt " chunk size.

- bug: Does not play with 3ch simultaneously #55
  Fixed Normal Play mode. It now supports all switches being pressed simultaneously.

- bug: Issue with binary FIFO queue #57
  Changed binary play mode to have FIFO queue. Previous specs were to have normal queue while playing.

- bug: Only 460ms of audio data of 500ms is played #56
  DMA was stopped before all the data could be output. Introduced wait loop to wait for DMA to finish everything.
Removed forgotten test code (LED_USBOff).
Disabled I2C polling after data is copied from USB.

- bug: Switch debounce - chattering #54
  If to consecutive scans (20 ms) show pressed button, we assume that a button is pressed.

- Gitgnore update.
  
- enh: Processing when an error occurs #52
  If any error is detected, MCU goes to infinite while loop. MCU can be reset (software reset) if STOP is pressed.

- bug: Pressing STB while STOP is pressed results in BUSY LED blink #58
  Inside binary play modes, when checking if stop is pressed, return from function if pressed. Previously it didn't return.

- bug: Audio file size #53
  NAND flash size was set to 2 Gbit, but actual flash size is 4 Gbit. Changed flash size.

- enh: Enabled DAC amplifier.
  
- bug: One count is missing when playing a WAVE file #50
  When fixing issue #40, round buffer check was shortened by 1 count.
To fix the current bug, round buffer check was restored and buffer size increased.
When 8-bit song is played, only half of the buffer is used.
When 16-bit song is played 1/4 of the buffer is used.


v2.0 / 2022-06-13 15:23:00 +0900:
- changelog: Included FW version in VoiceNaviMain.c
  
- bug: Ignore 8-bit data on 7-bit play mode
  Instead of ignoring just 7th bit, ignore all channels that are bigger than 127 (7-bit).

- bug: Input play mode doesn't cut the song #47
  Inserted detection if 2 signals are set at the same time. After double input, break the song playing and play the input that is still set.

- bug: Normal play mode channels should not alternate #46
  Reset previously pressed switch only if input is released. If input is pressed, remember previously pressed switch.

- bug: On interval delay watchdog timer triggers #45
  Because program was holding in while loop, watchdog timer reset the program. Added WDT reset into holding loop.

- bug:  Weird sound output on channels 9 to 12 #44
  Bug fixed. uint16_t value was going into uint8_t variable.

- enh: Watchdog implementation #43
  Implemented WDT. It starts automatically on power on. Period is about 522 ms.

- bug: Interrupt play was stuck in infinite loop.
  If forcefully stopped (interrupted), DMA buffer address wasn't reset. Added reset address.

- bug:  WPJ file corruption not detected #41
  Implemented full file corruption detection. If random file has extension wpj, error will be shown.

- bug: Non exclusive errors to exclusive errors
  Created exclusive errors. If one error happened before other, some weird blinking would occur. This is now fixed. First error has priority, further errors are not displayed.

- bug: Flash management for playlist table.
  Configured flash management for playlist table. If corrupted blocks are in beginning of flash, those blocks are skipped and data is written to next available block.

- bug: Output sound is cut at the beginning #40
  8-bit audio was stuck in first loop when filling play buffer. Fixed.

- bug: Output sound is cut at the beginning #40
  Fixed cut sound at start. Reduced delay from start signal to actual playback.

- bug: Popping sound #39
  Fixed bug introduced with commit: ac1170cda641362c732f92e4deb73e2e657df66c

- hw: New hardware revision.
